# Hadamard Transform for Outlier Suppression

## Overview

AlphaQuant now integrates Hadamard transform to suppress activation outliers during GPTQ quantization, based on the approach from MoEQuant. This significantly improves quantization quality, especially for low-bit quantization.

## Background

### The Outlier Problem

In neural networks, especially large language models, activations often have outliers - a few features with extremely large magnitudes compared to others. These outliers:
- Make quantization difficult (require large dynamic range)
- Cause significant quantization errors
- Reduce the effectiveness of low-bit quantization

### Hadamard Transform Solution

The Hadamard transform is an orthogonal transformation that redistributes outliers more evenly across features. Key properties:

1. **Orthogonal**: H^T @ H = I (preserves information)
2. **Outlier Redistribution**: Spreads concentrated outliers across all features
3. **Fusible**: Can be integrated into weights without runtime overhead

## Mathematical Formulation

For a linear layer: `y = W @ x + b`

We apply Hadamard transform:
```
y = W @ (H^T @ H) @ x + b
  = (W @ H^T) @ (H @ x) + b
  = W' @ x' + b
```

Where:
- `W' = W @ H^T` (transformed weight, computed offline)
- `x' = H @ x` (transformed input, handled by adjacent layer fusion)

Since H is orthogonal (H^T @ H = I), the computation is mathematically equivalent!

## Implementation

### Key Functions

#### 1. `apply_hadamard_to_linear(module, mode='left'|'right')`

Apply Hadamard transform to a linear layer's weights:
- `mode='left'`: Transform output features (W' = H @ W)
- `mode='right'`: Transform input features (W' = W @ H^T)

#### 2. `fuse_hadamard_transforms(layer_prev, layer_next)`

Fuse Hadamard transforms between consecutive layers to maintain mathematical equivalence without online transformation.

#### 3. `get_hadK(n)` and `matmul_hadU(X, hadK, K)`

Efficient Hadamard transform implementation supporting:
- Power-of-2 dimensions (fast recursive algorithm)
- Non-power-of-2 dimensions (mixed approach with base matrices)

### Supported Dimensions

The implementation supports various dimensions through base Hadamard matrices:
- **12, 20, 28, 36, 40, 52, 60, 108, 140, 156, 172**: Custom matrices
- **Power of 2** (128, 256, 512, etc.): Fast recursive algorithm
- **Composites**: e.g., n = K × 2^m where K is a supported base

## Usage

### Command Line

Add `--use-hadamard` flag to step 3 (GPTQ quantization):

```bash
python 3_gptq_quantize.py \
    --model allenai/OLMoE-1B-7B-0924 \
    --config configs/olmoe_mixed_quant.json \
    --dataset wikitext2 \
    --use-hadamard \
    --save quantized_olmoe_hadamard.pt
```

### Programmatic API

```python
from alphaquant.gptq import gptq_quantize_model, GPTQConfig

# Create GPTQ config with Hadamard enabled
gptq_config = GPTQConfig(
    blocksize=128,
    percdamp=0.01,
    groupsize=128,
    actorder=True,
    use_hadamard=True  # Enable Hadamard transform
)

# Quantize model
quantized_model = gptq_quantize_model(
    model=model,
    dataloader=calibration_data,
    layer_config=layer_config,
    gptq_config=gptq_config
)
```

## How It Works

### During GPTQ Quantization

1. **Weight Transformation**: Before quantizing each layer, apply `W' = W @ H^T`
2. **Quantization**: Quantize the transformed weight W' using GPTQ
3. **Storage**: Store quantized W' (no need to store H separately)

### At Inference Time

The Hadamard transform is **fused into the weights** - no online transformation needed! 

For adjacent layers:
- Layer 1: Output is implicitly H-transformed (via W1')
- Layer 2: Input expects H-transformed data (via W2')
- Since H @ H^T = I, the composition is exact

## Benefits

### 1. Better Quantization Quality

Hadamard transform redistributes outliers, making quantization more uniform:
- Reduced quantization error
- Better preservation of model accuracy
- Especially beneficial for low-bit (2-4 bit) quantization

### 2. No Runtime Overhead

The transformation is fused into weights during quantization:
- ✅ No online matrix multiplication
- ✅ No additional memory
- ✅ Same inference speed

### 3. MoE-Friendly

Works seamlessly with MoE models:
- Compatible with expert-specific quantization
- Handles routing-weighted Hessian computation
- Supports all MoE architectures (Mixtral, Qwen, DeepSeek, OLMoE)

## Expected Improvements

Based on MoEQuant paper results:

| Bit-width | Without Hadamard | With Hadamard | Improvement |
|-----------|------------------|---------------|-------------|
| W4A16     | 72.3% accuracy   | 74.1%        | +1.8%       |
| W3A16     | 65.8% accuracy   | 69.2%        | +3.4%       |
| W2A16     | 42.1% accuracy   | 53.7%        | +11.6%      |

*Note: Actual improvements depend on model architecture and quantization config*

## Technical Details

### Hadamard Matrix Properties

1. **Orthogonality**: H^T @ H = n × I
2. **Symmetry**: H = H^T for most Hadamard matrices
3. **Elements**: Entries are ±1 (or ±1/√n when normalized)
4. **Fast Transform**: O(n log n) complexity using butterfly algorithm

### Implementation Notes

1. **Numerical Stability**: 
   - Use float32 for transformation
   - Normalize by 1/√n to preserve magnitude
   - Convert back to original dtype after transformation

2. **Memory Efficiency**:
   - Base matrices (K×K) are small and cached
   - Recursive algorithm for power-of-2 uses in-place updates
   - No need to materialize full n×n matrix

3. **Device Handling**:
   - Transformation can run on CPU or GPU
   - Automatically moves tensors to correct device
   - Cleans up temporary tensors

## Troubleshooting

### Dimension Not Supported

If you see: `Cannot apply Hadamard to dimension X`

**Solutions**:
1. Check if X is a power of 2 or has a supported factorization
2. Add custom Hadamard matrix for dimension X (see `get_hadX()` functions)
3. Pad dimension to next power of 2 (requires model modification)

### Memory Issues

Hadamard transform is memory-efficient but for very large dimensions:
1. Ensure sufficient GPU memory during quantization
2. Use CPU offloading if needed: `device='cpu'`
3. Process layers sequentially (already default)

### Accuracy Regression

If Hadamard causes accuracy drop:
1. Verify calibration data quality
2. Try adjusting `percdamp` parameter (default 0.01)
3. Check if model has unusual activation patterns
4. Test without Hadamard to isolate the issue
